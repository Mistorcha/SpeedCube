# SpeedCube
Fully functional SpeedCube with scrambling, possibility to turn all faces, Letter order for BLD solving

Inspired by Coding train challenge on Rubiks cube.

ToDo List: 
-Show faces rotation
-Import list of algorithm
-Create buttons for creating algo on the go
-Random scramble =======> (partially done, need to preven the same letter to pop more than once in a row)
-Ability to find letter sequence to solve in BLD
-Create random letter sequence to train in BLD (select the number of letters)
-Reset the cube by reversing all moves made since the cube was solved ====> DONE
